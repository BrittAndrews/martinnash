    <div class="about">

       <img src="../images/MN_headshot.jpg" alt="Nash">

      <p>
         Born in London to a British father and German mother, Martin Nash was instilled with an appreciative aesthetic while being raised in Atlanta. Nash holds an Interior Design degree from the Art Institute of Atlanta, and after working for premier ADAC showrooms for 16 years, Martin along with best friend and business partner, designer Dee Simmons, launched the Martin Nash showroom in May, 2013.
        <br>
        Bringing legendary furniture lines such as William Switzer and Charles Pollock with him, Martin Nash seeks and successfully obtains new modern luxury brands like Fuse Lighting, Interior Crafts and Scala Luxury. Rounding out the Martin Nash collection with Chip Cheatham's Chip + Company and Maya Romanoff, this eclectic mix of furniture, lighting, wallcoverings and curated objects creates a vibe that is "Urban, Organic and Groovy!"
        Nash's vision to bring a new, fresh energy to ADAC is highlighted by a twenty foot "Living Wall" which lights up the main ADAC atrium. Originally a Graffiti mural depicting the Atlanta cityscape, the most recent installation is a comic strip featuring a journey through the showroom. These bold statements of unexpected and revolutionary design changed the dynamics of ADAC and the surrounding design community.</p>
